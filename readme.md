['Barriers faced by newcomers to open source projects: a systematic review'][paper]

Hopefully it will be helpfull to open source maintainers.

# Barriers
- Social Interaction
- Finding a Way to Start
- Documentation Problems
- Newcomers' Previous Experience

## Social Interaction

### Socializing with the project members.

It is very important that the core members of the community are very close to the newcomer.

**Takeaway:** If you are a core member of the project and somebody new ask a question even if she already got a response, make feel her welcome anyway. Maybe ask her personally to do some little work.

### Receiving (timely and proper) response.

__“nearly 80% of newbie posts received replies, and that receiving timely responses, especially within 48 hours, was positively correlated with future participation.”__

**Takeaway:** Reply fast to any new question, if you cannot reply right at the moment at least let her know that you are thinking about the issue.

### Finding mentorship/expertise

The easier is to find a mentor the more probable is that the newcomer will remain involved in the project.

**Takeaway:** Personally nurture the newcomers, make them feel involved and explain to them why something is been made the way it is. It definitely takes a lot of effort, but if the newcomers become a core member of the project it will be worth a thousand times.

## Finding a Way to Start
