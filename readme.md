This document aim to be a syntetization of the paper:

['Barriers faced by newcomers to open source projects: a systematic review'][paper]

Hopefully it will be helpful to open source maintainers.

# Barriers
- Social Interaction
- Finding a Way to Start
- Documentation Problems
- Newcomers' Previous Experience

## Social Interaction

### Socializing with the project members

It is very important that the core members of the community are very close to the newcomer.

**Takeaway:** If you are a core member of the project and somebody new ask a question even if she already got a response, make her feel welcome anyway. Maybe ask her personally to do some little work.

### Receiving (timely and proper) response

__“nearly 80% of newbie posts received replies, and that receiving timely responses, especially within 48 hours, was positively correlated with future participation.”__

**Takeaway:** Reply fast to any new question, if you cannot reply right at the moment at least let her know that you are thinking about the issue.

### Finding mentorship/expertise

The easier is to find a mentor the more probable is that the newcomer will remain involved in the project.

**Takeaway:** Personally nurture the newcomers, make them feel involved and explain to them why something is been made the way it is. It definitely takes a lot of effort, but if the newcomers become a core member of the project it will be worth a thousand times.

## Finding a Way to Start

### Finding Appropriate Issue/Task

Find the appropriate task to do is hard, the community expect that a newcomer will find itself what to do next, it is not so obvious.

**Takeaway:** Try to point the newcomer to a simple task to do. Also keep a very visible list of easy task that can be accomplished very easily.

### Finding the correct artifact to fix an issue

There are infinite way to address the same issues, but few way that makes really sense in your project, newcomers don't yet know those way.

**Takeaway:** If you had a discussion about a particular issue or if you read some resource, or if you code a prototype point those artifact to the newcomer.

## Code Issues

### Dealing with Code Complexity/Instability

The more complex is the code the harder is to contribute.

**Takeaway:** Keep the code as simple as possible (obviously) and explain how and why the complex things are complex.

### Understanding the Project Structure/Architecture

Understand the whole project is hard, harder than understand the sum of all the little module that compose the project.

**Takeaway:** Build a document (text or image) that explain what is flow of the information in the program, will help to understand what is happening in the code.

### Setting up Local Work Space

It is very important to be able to get start as quickly as possible, nobody likes to dig in old mailist archive to understand only how to run the code.

**Takeaway:** Keep a list of the action to do in order to get the system up and running.

## Documentation Problem

### Outdated Documentation

Outdated documentation is a waste of time for everybody.

**Takeaway:** Be sure that is very clear at what version of the project a documentation page is referring, consider eliminate documentation that is referring to a deprecate version.

### Information Overload

A rich documentation is necessary, a crowed documentation will just slow down.

**Takeaway:** Organize your documentation with the same effort you organize your code, don't write a ton of pages without organize them in a coherent corpus.

### Code Comments not Clear

A confusing comment is worse than no comment at all.

**Takeaway:** Remember that code is suppose to be read by humans first and foremost, then by machine.

## Newcomer's Previous Experience

### Lacking of Process and Practises

Newcomers need also to learn how to submit patches or make suggestion, it can be discourage.

**Takeaway** Make sure that is obvious how to contribute to the project, a contributing page is always necessary.

### Lacking of Domain Expertise

Newcomers who haven't work on similar project before can found very difficult to contribute.

**Takeaway:** Try to point people toward a problems they already know.

### Lacking of Technical Expertise

Not every task demand the same level of expertness, less expert coders should starting out with simple task.

**Takeaway:** Direct the less skilled coder to easier problem, it is a win-win scenario, they will feel accomplished when their patch is accept and you won't waste time reviewing a sub-optimal solution.
