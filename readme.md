This document aim to be a syntetization of the paper:

['Barriers faced by newcomers to open source projects: a systematic review'][paper]

Hopefully it will be helpfull to open source maintainers.

# Barriers
- Social Interaction
- Finding a Way to Start
- Documentation Problems
- Newcomers' Previous Experience

## Social Interaction

### Socializing with the project members

It is very important that the core members of the community are very close to the newcomer.

**Takeaway:** If you are a core member of the project and somebody new ask a question even if she already got a response, make feel her welcome anyway. Maybe ask her personally to do some little work.

### Receiving (timely and proper) response

__“nearly 80% of newbie posts received replies, and that receiving timely responses, especially within 48 hours, was positively correlated with future participation.”__

**Takeaway:** Reply fast to any new question, if you cannot reply right at the moment at least let her know that you are thinking about the issue.

### Finding mentorship/expertise

The easier is to find a mentor the more probable is that the newcomer will remain involved in the project.

**Takeaway:** Personally nurture the newcomers, make them feel involved and explain to them why something is been made the way it is. It definitely takes a lot of effort, but if the newcomers become a core member of the project it will be worth a thousand times.

## Finding a Way to Start

### Finding Appropriate Issue/Task

Find the appropriate task to do is hard, the community expect that a newcomer will find itself what to do next, it is not so obvious.

**Takeaway:** Try to point the newcomer to a simple task to do. Also keep a very visible list of easy task that can be accomplished very easily.

### Finding the correct artifact to fix an issue

There are infinte way to address the same issues, but few way that makes really sense in your project, newcomers don't yet know those way.

**Takeaway:** If you had a discussion about a particular issue or if you read some reasource, or if you code a prototype point those artifact to the newcomer.

## Code Issues

### Dealing with Code Complexity/Instability

The more complex is the code the harder is to contribuite.

**Takeaway:** Keep the code as simple as possible (obviously) and explain how and why those things are complex.

### Understanding the Project Structure/Architecture
